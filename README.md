# Slower Dirt Accrual

A mod for [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com) that slows down accrual of dirt on players' bodies and clothing.  
The multipliers for dirt accrual, the range to which multipliers should be applied, and the types of accrual that are slowed are configurable via sandbox options.
